- ✅ Priority ranking
- ✅ Implementation roadmap
- ✅ **11 Priority 1 substances ADDED to database:**
  1. Oxycodone (fake M30 crisis coverage)
  2. Hydrocodone (Vicodin/Norco)
  3. Mephedrone (4-MMC cathinone)
  4. Alpha-PVP (Flakka - "zombie drug")

  10. Lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse - most prescribed ADHD med)
  11. Etizolam (RC benzo in fake Xanax)
  12. Flualprazolam (ultra-potent RC benzo)

### Stats:
- **Before:** ~60 substances
- **After:** ~79 substances (+19 this session! 🚀🚀)
- **Priority 1:** ✅ **100% COMPLETE** (11 substances)
- **Priority 2:** ✅ **100% COMPLETE** (8 substances)
- **Total missing:** ~21-31 substances
- **Coverage:** **79% of 100-substance goal!**

### Next Steps:
1. Continue with Priority 1 substances (Alpha-PVP, MDPV, Methylone)
2. Add more cathinones (major gap)
3. Add RC benzos (Etizolam, Flualprazolam)
4. Add missing stimulants (Amphetamine, Vyvanse)

### Notes:
- Focus on substances with highest harm reduction impact first
- Counterfeit pills (oxy, hydro, pharma benzos) are current crisis
- Cathinones sold as MDMA still major issue
- Research chemicals (3-MeO-PCP, etizolam, etc.) increasingly common

**Remember:** The goal is comprehensive harm reduction coverage, not recreational drug encyclopedia. Prioritize substances people are actually encountering and being harmed by.
