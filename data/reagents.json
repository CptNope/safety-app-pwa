      "origins": "Developed in 1896 by Russian chemist E. Marquis for testing opium alkaloids. Originally used in pharmaceutical quality control and later adapted for forensic drug identification in the early 20th century. Became the most widely used presumptive drug test in law enforcement and harm reduction.",
      "usage": "Primary screening test for MDMA, amphetamines, opioids, and many other substances. Place tiny sample (~1-2mg) on white ceramic surface, add 1-2 drops of reagent, observe immediate color change. Purple/black indicates MDMA/MDA, orange indicates amphetamines, dark purple indicates opioids. Results appear within seconds but observe for 60 seconds. Most versatile reagent—should be first test performed. Cannot distinguish between chemically similar substances (MDMA vs MDA). Always use multiple reagents for confirmation.",

      "usage": "Secondary confirmation test particularly useful for MDMA/MDA differentiation and opioid identification. MDMA produces dark blue-black reaction (vs Marquis purple-black), helping confirm identity. Useful for distinguishing DXM (yellow-green) from other substances. Opioids produce blue-green or olive colors. Place sample on white surface, add 1-2 drops, observe within 60 seconds. Often used after Marquis to narrow down identification.

      "usage": "Specialized test for differentiating amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA, and MDA. MDMA produces black or very dark blue-black, amphetamine produces olive-brown or green, methamphetamine produces blue-green. Particularly useful because it shows different colors for MDMA vs amphetamine (whereas Marquis shows similar colors). Essential for detecting amphetamine cuts in MDMA samples.

Widely adopted by drug checking services and DIY test kit manufacturers in 1990s-2000s as essential MDMA verification tool.",
      "usage": "CRITICAL test for distinguishing MDMA (secondary amine) from methamphetamine/amphetamine (primary amines). MDMA produces BLUE reaction, methamphetamine produces NO COLOR CHANGE or faint pink. This is the definitive test to confirm MDMA vs meth. Two-part reagent: Part A + Part B mixed on sample. If blue appears, it's MDMA or MDA. If NO blue, it's likely meth or amphetamine (or not an amphetamine at all).

Became essential in psychedelic harm reduction in 1990s-2000s when dangerous NBOMe compounds (fake LSD) emerged. Now the single most important test for LSD verification—distinguishes real LSD from potentially lethal NBOMe analogues sold as 'acid'.",
      "usage": "ESSENTIAL test for any blotter/tab suspected to be LSD. Detects indole ring structure present in LSD, psilocybin/psilocin, DMT, and tryptamines. LSD, psilocybin, and DMT produce PURPLE color. NBOMe compounds (25I-NBOMe, etc.) produce NO COLOR CHANGE—this is critical because NBOMes can be lethal at doses that fit on blotter. For blotter: cut tiny corner (~1mm), place in white dish, add 1 drop Ehrlich, wait up to 5 minutes (slower reaction than other reagents). Purple = likely LSD or tryptamine. NO purple = NOT LSD, likely NBOMe or inactive blotter. Life-saving test—NBOMes have killed users who thought they were taking LSD. Always test blotter with Ehrlich before consuming.",

Less widely available than standard Ehrlich but offered by some specialized test kit vendors.",
      "usage": "Alternative or complementary test to Ehrlich for detecting indoles in suspected LSD, psilocybin, or tryptamines. Functions similarly to Ehrlich but may show faster reaction times or clearer purple color development. Use same protocol as Ehrlich: small sample, 1 drop reagent, observe for purple color indicating indole presence. Some users prefer Hofmann for blotter testing due to reportedly more vivid purple with LSD. Can be used alongside Ehrlich for additional confirmation or as substitute when Ehrlich unavailable. Like Ehrlich, purple indicates indole (LSD/psilocybin/DMT), no color change indicates NBOMe or inactive substance. Important for harm reduction when testing psychedelics.",

Psilocybin is considered one of the safest psychoactive substances with minimal toxicity and no addiction potential.",
        "origins": "Used in indigenous Mesoamerican spiritual and healing ceremonies for thousands of years. First isolated from Psilocybe mushrooms by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann (who also discovered LSD) in 1958. Popularized in Western culture by R. Gordon Wasson's 1957 Life Magazine article. Scheduled in 1970 despite therapeutic research. Recently decriminalized or legalized in several US cities and states.",
        "uses": "Traditional: Spiritual ceremonies, divination, healing rituals in indigenous cultures. Current research: Treatment for depression, anxiety (especially end-of-life), PTSD, addiction (smoking, alcohol), cluster headaches, and OCD with breakthrough results. Recreational: Introspection, nature connection, creative insights, mystical experiences. Microdosing: Sub-perceptual doses for mood, creativity, and focus enhancement.",
        "dangers": "Physiologically very safe—no lethal dose established, no organ toxicity. Primary risks are psychological: 'bad trips' with anxiety, paranoia, or terrifying experiences, especially in unsafe settings or high doses. Can trigger latent mental health conditions or exacerbate existing ones. HPPD (flashbacks) rare but possible. Mushroom misidentification can be fatal—only consume from trusted sources or expert identification. No physical addiction but psychological attachment possible. Set and setting crucial for positive experiences. Contraindicated with certain mental health conditions (schizophrenia, bipolar).",

        "origins": "First synthesized in 1931 by Canadian chemist Richard Manske. Found in numerous plants used in South American shamanic ceremonies (ayahuasca brew contains DMT from Psychotria viridis). Modern Western use popularized by Terence McKenna's lectures in 1980s-90s. Known as 'the spirit molecule' from Rick Strassman's 1990s clinical research and subsequent book/documentary.",
        "uses": "Traditional: Ayahuasca ceremonies in South American indigenous cultures (DMT + MAOI from Banisteriopsis caapi vine). Modern: Brief but intense psychedelic experiences, spiritual exploration, entity contact reports. Research: Strassman's studies suggested potential for understanding consciousness. Recreational: 'Breakthrough' experiences, visual phenomena beyond other psychedelics. Typically smoked/vaporized for 5-15min effects or oral with MAOI for hours-long ayahuasca experience.",
        "dangers": "Overwhelming psychological intensity—can be terrifying for unprepared users. Risk of injury during experience due to complete dissociation from physical reality. Entities and alien landscapes can cause lasting existential confusion or fear. Extremely rapid onset (seconds) prevents gradual adaptation. Post-experience integration challenges. When used as ayahuasca (oral + MAOI), dangerous drug interactions: SSRIs, other antidepressants, stimulants, tyramine-rich foods can cause serotonin syndrome or hypertensive crisis. Pure DMT relatively safe physiologically but psychological impact profound. Not recommended for those with psychotic disorders or family history."

      "description": {
        "overview": "5-Methoxy-N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) is an extremely potent, fast-acting psychedelic tryptamine distinct from DMT. Produces intense ego dissolution, unity experiences, and 'white light' phenomena rather than DMT's colorful visuals and entities. Naturally found in various plants and Colorado River toad (Bufo alvarius) venom. Effects last 15-45 minutes but feel timeless. Considered one of the most powerful psychedelics.",
        "origins": "Isolated from plant sources in 1936. Found in Bufo alvarius (Sonoran Desert toad) venom in 1965. Synthetic version available. Traditional use by indigenous South American tribes in yopo snuff (Anadenanthera). Modern use popularized by ethnobotanist Jonathan Ott and later by 'toad smoking' phenomenon. Not as culturally widespread as DMT or ayahuasca. Recently scheduled in many countries but research ongoing.",
        "uses": "Traditional: Yopo snuff ceremonies. Modern: Ego death experiences, mystical/spiritual exploration, therapeutic potential for trauma/addiction. Some report life-changing realizations and healing. Effects: Complete dissolution of self, unity with universe, 'white light,' profound peace or terror depending on set/setting. Minimal visuals compared to DMT—more about internal experience. Duration 15-45 minutes when smoked/vaporized. Typical dose 5-20mg (extremely potent). Sometimes used in therapeutic contexts but requires experienced facilitation.",
        "dangers": "EXTREMELY INTENSE—overwhelming even for experienced psychedelic users. Can be terrifying if unprepared—complete ego death with no frame of reference. Risk of physical injury during experience (thrashing, falling). Should never be used standing or near hazards. Respiratory depression possible at high doses or combinations. Dangerous with MAOIs (serotonin syndrome, hypertensive crisis). Toad venom harvesting harms endangered species—synthetic preferred. Very difficult to distinguish from DMT by appearance—lab testing recommended. Psychological integration challenges post-experience. Can trigger lasting existential crisis or spiritual emergency. Contraindicated for heart conditions (cardiovascular stress). Not for recreational use—requires serious intention and safe setting. Reports of deaths from improper use or combinations."

Commonly known as a 'date rape drug' though most use is voluntary. Liquid form makes dosing dangerous.",
        "origins": "Synthesized in 1874, developed as an anesthetic in 1960s but abandoned due to side effects. Used by bodybuilders in 1980s for alleged growth hormone release and sleep enhancement.

Precursors GBL and 1,4-BD legal in many areas and convert to GHB in body.",
        "uses": "Medical: Xyrem (sodium oxybate) prescribed for narcolepsy with cataplexy. Rare use as anesthetic in some countries. Recreational: Euphoria, disinhibition, enhanced sociability and sexuality. Popular in club/rave scenes and 'chemsex' contexts. Bodybuilding: Claimed (unproven) benefits for muscle growth and recovery. Typical dose 1-2.5g but highly variable by concentration. Duration 1.5-3 hours.",
        "dangers": "EXTREME OVERDOSE RISK: Very narrow therapeutic window. Difference between desired effects and unconsciousness can be <1g. Sudden onset—conscious to unconscious in minutes. Respiratory depression, vomiting while unconscious (aspiration risk), seizures. No antidote—supportive care only. Combining with alcohol is extremely dangerous and often fatal. Physical dependence develops quickly with regular use. Withdrawal can be life-threatening (similar to alcohol). Liquid form makes accurate dosing nearly impossible. Concentration varies wildly between batches. Used in drug-facilitated sexual assault. Memory impairment and blackouts common. Chronic use linked to cognitive impairment. GBL and 1,4-BD (precursors) are even more dangerous due to unpredictable conversion rates.",

        "uses": "No current legitimate medical use. Veterinary use discontinued. Illicitly used for dissociative effects, numbness, feeling of strength/invincibility. Sometimes unknowingly consumed when sold as other drugs. Can be smoked (often on mint, parsley), snorted, injected, or taken orally. Effects 4-6 hours (oral/snorted), 30min-1hour (smoked). Doses vary wildly due to illicit production.",
        "dangers": "Extremely unpredictable and dangerous. Notorious for violent, bizarre, self-destructive behavior. Superhuman strength feeling leads to severe injuries. Numbness prevents pain awareness—users have seriously injured themselves without realizing. Acute: Aggression, psychosis, seizures, hyperthermia, hypertensive crisis, coma, death.

Aldous Huxley's 'The Doors of Perception' (1954) popularized mescaline experiences. Scheduled in 1970 but peyote use remains legal for Native American Church.",
        "uses": "Traditional: Sacred medicine in indigenous ceremonies, vision quests, healing rituals (peyote and San Pedro). Recreational: Visual hallucinations, introspection, nature connection, spiritual experiences. San Pedro cactus tea more common than peyote due to conservation concerns. Typical dose 200-400mg mescaline or equivalent cactus material. Duration 10-12 hours. Known for warm, empathogenic quality alongside psychedelic effects.",
        "dangers": "Physiologically very safe—no lethal dose established. Primary risks psychological: bad trips, anxiety, paranoia especially at high doses or unsafe settings. Nausea and vomiting common during come-up (traditional preparation includes purging as spiritual cleansing). Cactus preparations can cause more stomach discomfort than pure mescaline. Can trigger latent mental health conditions. Peyote endangered due to overharvesting—ethical concerns with non-traditional use. San Pedro more sustainable. Contraindicated with heart conditions (slight cardiovascular stimulation). Very long duration can be exhausting. Set and setting crucial.

Distinctive bitter/metallic taste (LSD is tasteless) and causes severe tongue numbness. Active at sub-milligram doses, highly dose-sensitive with narrow safety margin.",
        "origins": "Synthesized in 2003 by chemist Ralf Heim at Free University of Berlin for serotonin receptor research. Never intended for human consumption. Appeared on recreational market around 2010 as 'legal LSD alternative' and frequently sold as actual LSD. Multiple deaths reported 2012-2015 led to emergency scheduling. Part of NBOMe series (25I, 25C, 25B) all with similar dangers.",
        "uses": "No medical use. Recreational: Intense visual hallucinations, euphoria, stimulation. Often consumed unknowingly when sold as LSD. Typical dose 200-800mcg on blotter (appears identical to LSD blotter). Effects 6-10 hours. Some users sought NBOMe specifically for intense visuals, but deaths and unpredictability have reduced intentional use. Harm reduction communities strongly discourage NBOMe use and emphasize testing all 'LSD' with Ehrlich reagent.",

Causes severe vasoconstriction leading to seizures, hyperthermia, multi-organ failure, death. Significantly more dangerous than LSD, psilocybin, or mescaline. Bitter/metallic taste and tongue numbness are warning signs (LSD is tasteless and causes no numbness—only ink/paper taste). Ehrlich reagent shows NO reaction to NBOMes (LSD turns purple). Physical effects: increased heart rate and blood pressure to dangerous levels, risk of stroke/heart attack. Psychological: anxiety, paranoia, panic, bad trips. Some users have died from single 'common' doses. Unpredictable response between individuals. Often mis-sold as LSD putting unsuspecting users at risk. CRITICAL: If blotter tastes bitter or numbs tongue, SPIT IT OUT IMMEDIATELY.",

      "class": "benzodiazepine",
      "description": {
        "overview": "Alprazolam (Xanax) is a fast-acting, potent benzodiazepine prescribed for anxiety and panic disorders. Produces relaxation, sedation, and anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) effects. One of the most prescribed and most abused benzos due to rapid onset and euphoric effects at higher doses. Street 'Xanax' pills frequently counterfeit and contain fentanyl, other benzos (flualprazolam, etizolam), or no active ingredient.",
        "origins": "Developed by Upjohn (now Pfizer) in late 1960s, FDA-approved 1981. Became one of most prescribed psychiatric medications in US. Short half-life (6-12 hours) makes it effective for acute anxiety but also increases addiction potential. Available in immediate-release tablets (0.25mg to 2mg) and extended-release (Xanax XR). 'Bars' (2mg) became street drug of choice in 2000s-2010s, often combined with opioids or alcohol.",
        "uses": "Medical: Anxiety disorders, panic disorder, anxiety associated with depression. Short-term use recommended due to tolerance and dependence. Rapid relief of acute anxiety/panic attacks. Recreational: Sedation, disinhibition, euphoria (at high doses), blackout experiences, combining with opioids or alcohol ('lean'). Popular in hip-hop culture. Pressed counterfeit pills widely available on street/dark web. Typical prescribed dose 0.25-2mg; recreational users often take 4-10mg+ leading to blackouts and dangerous behavior.",
        "dangers": "EXTREMELY ADDICTIVE—physical dependence develops within weeks. Withdrawal can be FATAL (seizures, delirium tremens)—requires medical supervision to safely discontinue. Blackouts and amnesia common at recreational doses leading to dangerous behavior, accidents, sexual assault. Combining with opioids or alcohol frequently FATAL (respiratory depression). Counterfeit 'Xanax' bars often contain fentanyl—numerous overdose deaths. Pressed pills may contain flualprazolam (longer-acting, more sedating RC benzo) or other research chemicals. Tolerance develops rapidly requiring higher doses. Cognitive impairment, motor coordination issues increase fall/accident risk. Paradoxical reactions possible (increased anxiety, aggression). Rebound anxiety when stopping. Elderly particularly vulnerable to falls, confusion, dementia-like symptoms. Reagent tests don't work on benzos—fentanyl test strips essential for any street pills.",

Often combined with fentanyl in pressed pills—LETHAL combination. Overdose causes profound sedation, respiratory depression (especially with other depressants), coma. No quality control—dosage unpredictable. Some 'Xanax' bars contain 3-5mg flualprazolam (equivalent to 6-10mg+ alprazolam). Cannot be distinguished from real Xanax by appearance.

        "overview": "Phenibut (β-phenyl-GABA) is a GABA-B receptor agonist developed in Russia for anxiety, sold as unregulated dietary supplement in US. Produces anxiety relief, sociability, mild euphoria, and improved sleep. Not a benzodiazepine but has similar effects. Legal and widely available online. Marketed as nootropic/cognitive enhancer. Addiction potential severely underestimated by users.",
        "origins": "Developed in 1960s Soviet Union for cosmonauts to reduce stress without sedation impairment. Prescription medication in Russia, Latvia, Ukraine (trade names: Noofen, Anvifen). Remains unscheduled in US, UK, and most Western countries. Sold as dietary supplement despite not being approved by FDA. Became popular in nootropic/biohacking communities in 2010s. Reddit, Longecity forums popularized use.",
        "uses": "Medical (in Russia): Anxiety disorders, insomnia, PTSD, alcohol withdrawal. Typical dose 250-1000mg. Supplement use: Anxiety relief, social anxiety reduction, sleep aid, mood enhancement. Some users report improved sociability and reduced social inhibition (similar to alcohol but without intoxication). Popular for public speaking, dates, interviews. Effects: 2-4 hours onset, 15-24 hour duration. Recreational: Euphoria at higher doses (2-3g+), combining with alcohol or other drugs (dangerous).",
        "dangers": "SEVERE PHYSICAL DEPENDENCE develops with daily use (even at recommended doses). Withdrawal can be DANGEROUS: seizures, psychosis, hallucinations, severe anxiety, insomnia, agitation. Withdrawal worse than many report—can last weeks. Tolerance develops rapidly requiring dose escalation. Long half-life (5-6 hours) but effects last much longer—easy to redose and overdose. Combining with alcohol or other depressants dangerous (respiratory depression). Liver toxicity possible with chronic use. Very difficult to quit once dependent—requires slow taper (months). Rebound anxiety severe. Highly variable individual response—some very sensitive. Sold with minimal warnings about addiction potential. Users often don't realize they're dependent until they try to stop. Not detected on standard drug tests. Quality varies between suppliers—heavy metal contamination possible. Some countries beginning to schedule/ban."

Produces euphoria, emotional openness, stimulation, and psychedelic visuals. Duration significantly longer than MDMA (8-14 hours). Popular in UK club scenes before being banned. Part of benzofuran family (5-APB, 5-MAPB, etc.).",
        "origins": "Synthesized in 1993 by David Nichols at Purdue University for research purposes. Remained obscure research chemical until late 2000s. Marketed in UK as legal high under brand name 'Benzo Fury' in early 2010s before being scheduled in 2013. Gained popularity as MDMA substitute when MDMA quality/availability declined in UK. Now Schedule I in most countries but still available on research chemical markets.",
        "uses": "No medical use. Recreational: MDMA-like empathy and euphoria, music enhancement, dancing, emotional connection. Produces more psychedelic visuals than MDMA, especially at higher doses. Popular at festivals and raves as MDMA alternative. Typical dose 80-120mg; effects last 8-14 hours (much longer than MDMA's 4-6 hours). Some users prefer benzofurans for longer-lasting experiences; others find duration exhausting.",
        "dangers": "Very long duration can be physically and mentally exhausting. Cardiovascular stress: increased heart rate and blood pressure over extended period. Vasoconstriction. Serotonin depletion worse than MDMA due to longer duration—severe comedown depression possible. Neurotoxicity concerns similar to MDMA but less studied. Jaw clenching, eye wiggling (nystagmus), overheating risk. Difficult to sleep for 12-18 hours after dosing. Higher doses produce intense psychedelic effects that can be overwhelming. Limited research on long-term effects. Sold as MDMA or mixed into pills—always test. Reagent reactions similar to MDMA but distinguishable with multiple reagents. Tolerance develops; cross-tolerance with MDMA. Recommended waiting period 3+ months between uses like MDMA.",

Commonly diverted for academic performance enhancement.",
        "origins": "First synthesized in 1944 by Leandro Panizzon at Ciba (now Novartis). Named 'Ritalin' after his wife Rita who used it for low blood pressure. FDA-approved in 1955 for treating hyperactivity and later ADHD. Became Schedule II controlled substance in 1971.

Weaker than morphine (codeine is a prodrug that converts to morphine in the liver). Found in prescription medications like Tylenol #3, cough syrups (promethazine-codeine), and standalone pills. Popular in 'lean' or 'purple drank' culture when mixed with soda and candy.",
        "origins": "Isolated from opium in 1832 by French chemist Pierre Robiquet. Widely used in medicine since late 1800s as safer alternative to morphine for mild pain. Included in over-the-counter cough syrups until stricter regulations in 1970s-90s. Hip-hop culture popularized 'lean' (codeine cough syrup + soda) in 1990s-2000s Houston scene, spreading nationally. Now Schedule II-V depending on formulation and concentration.",
        "uses": "Medical: Mild-moderate pain relief, cough suppression, diarrhea treatment. Often combined with acetaminophen (Tylenol #3) or aspirin. Typical dose 15-60mg for pain. Recreational: 'Lean' or 'purple drank' (codeine cough syrup + promethazine + soda + candy), euphoria, relaxation, nodding. Doses 60-120mg+ for recreational effects. Effects: 3-4 hours duration, less intense than other opioids but still addictive.",
        "dangers": "Addiction and physical dependence develop with regular use—opioid withdrawal includes muscle aches, anxiety, insomnia, nausea. Respiratory depression at high doses or when combined with other depressants (alcohol, benzos, promethazine). Acetaminophen toxicity—many codeine pills contain APAP which causes liver damage/failure at high doses (>4000mg daily). 'Lean' culture glamorizes dangerous behavior—multiple celebrity deaths (Pimp C, DJ Screw, Lil Peep used multiple substances). Genetic variation in CYP2D6 enzyme means some people convert codeine to morphine very efficiently (ultra-rapid metabolizers = overdose risk) while others get no effect (poor metabolizers). Constipation, nausea, itching common. Promethazine in cough syrup adds sedation and respiratory depression risk. Driving impairment. Gateway to stronger opioids for some users.",

Legal status varies by country and US state.",
        "origins": "Used traditionally in Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia for centuries by laborers to combat fatigue and manage pain. Leaves chewed fresh or brewed as tea. Western awareness grew in 1800s but remained obscure until 2000s internet commerce. Banned in Thailand (ironically, its origin) since 1943 but recently re-legalized. DEA attempted scheduling in 2016 but withdrew after public outcry. Currently unscheduled federally in US but banned in several states.",
        "uses": "Traditional: Energy, pain relief, treating diarrhea, wound healing. Modern: Self-treatment for chronic pain (alternative to prescription opioids), opioid withdrawal aid (reduces symptoms), anxiety and depression relief, energy and focus (low doses), recreational sedation (high doses). Strains: Red (sedating, pain relief), Green (balanced), White (energizing). Typical dose 2-5g (moderate) to 5-10g+ (strong). Often consumed as powder in capsules, 'toss and wash,' or tea.",
        "dangers": "Physical dependence and withdrawal with regular use—symptoms similar to mild opioid withdrawal (muscle aches, irritability, insomnia, runny nose). Tolerance develops, requiring increasing doses. Nausea and 'wobbles' (dizziness, nausea) common at high doses or with certain strains. Constipation (opioid effect). Liver toxicity rare but reported with chronic heavy use or adulterated products. Respiratory depression possible when combined with other CNS depressants (alcohol, benzos, opioids)—deaths almost always involve poly-drug use. Seizures reported in rare cases. Quality control issues: products may be contaminated with salmonella, heavy metals, or adulterated with actual opioids. Some extracts (shots, enhanced products) extremely potent. Addiction potential debated but real for some users. Can test positive for methadone on some drug tests (false positive).",
