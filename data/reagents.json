        "overview": "3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), commonly known as ecstasy or molly, is an empathogen-entactogen that produces feelings of emotional openness, empathy, and euphoria. It's one of the most popular recreational drugs worldwide, particularly in dance and festival settings.",
        "origins": "First synthesized by Merck pharmaceutical company in 1912, MDMA remained obscure until the 1970s when chemist Alexander Shulgin resynthesized it and introduced it to psychotherapists. It gained popularity as a therapeutic tool before becoming a Schedule I controlled substance in 1985.",
        "uses": "Originally explored for marriage counseling and PTSD treatment in psychotherapy. Currently used recreationally for its prosocial effects, emotional warmth, and sensory enhancement. FDA-approved clinical trials are ongoing for PTSD-assisted therapy with promising results.",
        "dangers": "Neurotoxicity concerns with frequent use, especially at high doses or elevated body temperatures. Risk of hyperthermia, hyponatremia (water intoxication), serotonin syndrome. Often adulterated with methamphetamine, MDA, cathinones, or other stimulants. Increasing fentanyl contamination in pressed pills. Can cause short-term memory issues, depression, and anxiety in the days following use ('comedown')."

        "overview": "Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a powerful hallucinogenic drug that profoundly alters perception, mood, and thought. Known for producing vivid visual hallucinations, synesthesia, and mystical experiences, LSD is one of the most potent psychoactive substances known, active at microgram doses.",
        "origins": "Synthesized in 1938 by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann at Sandoz Laboratories while researching ergot alkaloids. Its psychedelic properties were discovered accidentally in 1943 when Hofmann absorbed a small amount through his skin. Widely used in psychiatric research in the 1950s-60s before being scheduled in 1968.",
        "uses": "Historically used in psychotherapy for treating alcoholism, anxiety, and depression. Currently being researched for treatment of PTSD, anxiety, depression, and cluster headaches. Recreationally used for introspection, creativity enhancement, and transcendent experiences. Microdosing (sub-perceptual doses) popular for cognitive enhancement.",
        "dangers": "Psychological risks include 'bad trips,' anxiety, paranoia, and exacerbation of underlying mental health conditions. Rare but serious risk of persistent perceptual changes (HPPD). No physical addiction or toxicity, but psychologically intense. Primary danger is NBOMe compounds sold as LSD—these can be fatal and taste bitter/metallic. Real LSD is tasteless and causes tongue numbness only from ink/paper."

'Meth mouth' (severe dental decay), skin sores from compulsive picking, extreme weight loss, psychosis, paranoia, and violent behavior. Cardiovascular strain can cause heart attack and stroke. Often cut with MSM, ISO, or N-Iso (look identical). Sleep deprivation from binges causes hallucinations and psychotic breaks. Highly addictive with devastating social consequences."

      "description": {
        "overview": "Psilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in over 200 species of mushrooms ('magic mushrooms' or 'shrooms'). It produces profound alterations in perception, mood, thought, and sense of self. Psilocybin is considered one of the safest psychoactive substances with minimal toxicity and no addiction potential.",
        "origins": "Used in indigenous Mesoamerican spiritual and healing ceremonies for thousands of years. First isolated from Psilocybe mushrooms by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann (who also discovered LSD) in 1958. Popularized in Western culture by R. Gordon Wasson's 1957 Life Magazine article. Scheduled in 1970 despite therapeutic research. Recently decriminalized or legalized in several US cities and states.",
        "uses": "Traditional: Spiritual ceremonies, divination, healing rituals in indigenous cultures. Current research: Treatment for depression, anxiety (especially end-of-life), PTSD, addiction (smoking, alcohol), cluster headaches, and OCD with breakthrough results. Recreational: Introspection, nature connection, creative insights, mystical experiences. Microdosing: Sub-perceptual doses for mood, creativity, and focus enhancement.",
        "dangers": "Physiologically very safe—no lethal dose established, no organ toxicity. Primary risks are psychological: 'bad trips' with anxiety, paranoia, or terrifying experiences, especially in unsafe settings or high doses. Can trigger latent mental health conditions or exacerbate existing ones. HPPD (flashbacks) rare but possible. Mushroom misidentification can be fatal—only consume from trusted sources or expert identification. No physical addiction but psychological attachment possible. Set and setting crucial for positive experiences. Contraindicated with certain mental health conditions (schizophrenia, bipolar)."

      "description": {
        "overview": "Fentanyl is an extremely potent synthetic opioid, approximately 50-100 times stronger than morphine and 30-50 times stronger than heroin. Originally developed for pain management and anesthesia, it has become a major driver of overdose deaths when illicitly manufactured and mixed into other drugs without users' knowledge.",
        "origins": "Synthesized in 1959 by Belgian physician Paul Janssen as a surgical analgesic. Introduced medically in the 1960s for anesthesia and chronic pain management via patches and lozenges. Illicitly manufactured fentanyl (IMF) emerged in the 1970s but exploded in the 2010s, fueling the current opioid crisis.",
        "uses": "Medical: Prescribed as transdermal patches (Duragesic), lozenges (Actiq), or IV anesthesia for severe pain and surgical procedures. Cancer patients and chronic pain management. Illicitly: Added to heroin to increase potency, pressed into counterfeit pills (fake oxycodone, Xanax), or mixed into cocaine, meth, and MDMA as adulterant.",
        "dangers": "EXTREMELY HIGH OVERDOSE RISK: 2mg (size of few grains of salt) can be lethal. Respiratory depression occurs within seconds to minutes. Naloxone (Narcan) required immediately for overdose reversal—may need multiple doses. Increasingly found in non-opioid drugs causing unexpected overdoses. Analogues (carfentanil, acetylfentanyl) are even more potent. Cross-contamination during production endangers entire drug supply. Most overdose deaths now involve fentanyl. Test strips essential for any street drugs."

        "overview": "Heroin (diacetylmorphine) is a highly addictive semi-synthetic opioid derived from morphine, which comes from opium poppy plants. It produces intense euphoria, pain relief, and sedation, but carries extreme risks of addiction, overdose, and infectious disease transmission. The current street supply is heavily contaminated with fentanyl.",
        "origins": "Synthesized from morphine in 1874 by English chemist C.R. Alder Wright. Commercialized by Bayer pharmaceutical company in 1898 as a 'safer' morphine substitute and cough suppressant (tradename 'Heroin'). Quickly recognized as highly addictive and banned in most countries by the 1920s-30s. Illicit production now centered in Afghanistan, Mexico, and Southeast Asia.",
        "uses": "No current medical use in the United States (diamorphine still used medically in UK for severe pain). Historically used for pain, cough suppression, and as morphine substitute. Recreationally used for intense euphoria, pain relief, and escape. Routes: injection (IV), smoking, snorting. IV use carries highest overdose and infection risk.",
        "dangers": "Extremely high addiction potential—physical dependence develops rapidly. Overdose causes respiratory depression and death, especially with fentanyl contamination (now in majority of heroin supply). HIV, Hepatitis C transmission from shared needles. Collapsed veins, bacterial infections, abscesses from injection. Withdrawal is intensely uncomfortable but not typically fatal. Xylazine (tranq) increasingly found in supply, causes severe wounds and doesn't respond to naloxone. Unpredictable potency makes every dose potentially lethal. Naloxone and fentanyl test strips are life-saving harm reduction tools."
