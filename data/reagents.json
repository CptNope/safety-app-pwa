      "origins": "Developed in 1896 by Russian chemist E. Marquis for testing opium alkaloids. Originally used in pharmaceutical quality control and later adapted for forensic drug identification in the early 20th century. Became the most widely used presumptive drug test in law enforcement and harm reduction.",
      "usage": "Primary screening test for MDMA, amphetamines, opioids, and many other substances. Place tiny sample (~1-2mg) on white ceramic surface, add 1-2 drops of reagent, observe immediate color change. Purple/black indicates MDMA/MDA, orange indicates amphetamines, dark purple indicates opioids. Results appear within seconds but observe for 60 seconds. Most versatile reagent—should be first test performed. Cannot distinguish between chemically similar substances (MDMA vs MDA). Always use multiple reagents for confirmation.",

Became essential in psychedelic harm reduction in 1990s-2000s when dangerous NBOMe compounds (fake LSD) emerged. Now the single most important test for LSD verification—distinguishes real LSD from potentially lethal NBOMe analogues sold as 'acid'.",
      "usage": "ESSENTIAL test for any blotter/tab suspected to be LSD. Detects indole ring structure present in LSD, psilocybin/psilocin, DMT, and tryptamines. LSD, psilocybin, and DMT produce PURPLE color. NBOMe compounds (25I-NBOMe, etc.) produce NO COLOR CHANGE—this is critical because NBOMes can be lethal at doses that fit on blotter. For blotter: cut tiny corner (~1mm), place in white dish, add 1 drop Ehrlich, wait up to 5 minutes (slower reaction than other reagents). Purple = likely LSD or tryptamine. NO purple = NOT LSD, likely NBOMe or inactive blotter. Life-saving test—NBOMes have killed users who thought they were taking LSD. Always test blotter with Ehrlich before consuming.",

Functions similarly to Ehrlich but may show faster reaction times or clearer purple color development. Use same protocol as Ehrlich: small sample, 1 drop reagent, observe for purple color indicating indole presence. Some users prefer Hofmann for blotter testing due to reportedly more vivid purple with LSD. Can be used alongside Ehrlich for additional confirmation or as substitute when Ehrlich unavailable. Like Ehrlich, purple indicates indole (LSD/psilocybin/DMT), no color change indicates NBOMe or inactive substance. Important for harm reduction when testing psychedelics.",

        "uses": "No medical use. Recreational: Identical effects to LSD—visual hallucinations, altered perception, mystical experiences. Microdosing popular (10-20mcg doses). Typical dose 100-150mcg on blotter paper. Duration 8-12 hours. Used interchangeably with LSD by many users. Some prefer it due to legal status in certain jurisdictions. Research: Tool for studying psychedelics in countries where LSD research restricted.",
        "dangers": "Same psychological risks as LSD: bad trips, anxiety, HPPD (rare), triggering latent mental illness. Very safe physiologically—no lethal dose, no organ toxicity. Legal ambiguity: may be prosecuted as LSD analogue under analogue acts. Quality varies—some blotter contains other substances. Should still use Ehrlich reagent to confirm indole (will react same as LSD). Dosing more consistent than street LSD due to research chemical market quality control. Main risk is unexpected intensity if user assumes it's weaker than LSD (it's not).",

Often sold as or confused with MDMA, MDA has a longer duration and more intense visual effects.",
        "origins": "First synthesized in 1910, predating MDMA by decades. Used experimentally in psychotherapy in the 1960s-70s before MDMA became popular. Nicknamed 'the love drug' in the 1960s counterculture. Became Schedule I in 1970. Currently resurging as MDMA alternative or adulterant in pressed pills.",
        "uses": "Historically explored in psychotherapy for emotional processing and couples therapy. Recreationally used for empathogenic and mild psychedelic effects at music events and festivals. Some users prefer MDA's more 'trippy' character versus MDMA's pure empathy. Often unintentionally consumed when sold as MDMA.",
        "dangers": "Similar neurotoxicity concerns as MDMA, possibly greater. Higher body temperature elevation risk (hyperthermia). More prone to causing confusion and anxiety than MDMA due to psychedelic effects. Often found as MDMA adulterant or sold as 'MDMA' in pressed pills. Simon's reagent shows NO reaction (primary amine vs MDMA's secondary amine)—key distinction. Longer duration (6-8 hours) can lead to dehydration and exhaustion.

Abuse potential significant—tolerance and psychological dependence develop. Neurotoxicity at high doses (dopamine depletion). Psychosis, paranoia, hallucinations with chronic high-dose use. Appetite suppression leads to malnutrition with chronic use. Insomnia, anxiety, irritability. Compulsive behaviors (picking skin, repetitive tasks). Severe comedown: fatigue, depression, cognitive impairment. Withdrawal: extreme fatigue, depression, increased appetite, sleeping for days. IV use carries infection risks. Nasal damage from snorting.

        "overview": "Fentanyl is an extremely potent synthetic opioid, approximately 50-100 times stronger than morphine and 30-50 times stronger than heroin. Originally developed for pain management and anesthesia, it has become a major driver of overdose deaths when illicitly manufactured and mixed into other drugs without users' knowledge.",
        "origins": "Synthesized in 1959 by Belgian physician Paul Janssen as a surgical analgesic. Introduced medically in the 1960s for anesthesia and chronic pain management via patches and lozenges. Illicitly manufactured fentanyl (IMF) emerged in the 1970s but exploded in the 2010s, fueling the current opioid crisis.",
        "uses": "Medical: Prescribed as transdermal patches (Duragesic), lozenges (Actiq), or IV anesthesia for severe pain and surgical procedures. Cancer patients and chronic pain management. Illicitly: Added to heroin to increase potency, pressed into counterfeit pills (fake oxycodone, Xanax), or mixed into cocaine, meth, and MDMA as adulterant.",
        "dangers": "EXTREMELY HIGH OVERDOSE RISK: 2mg (size of few grains of salt) can be lethal. Respiratory depression occurs within seconds to minutes. Naloxone (Narcan) required immediately for overdose reversal—may need multiple doses. Increasingly found in non-opioid drugs causing unexpected overdoses. Analogues (carfentanil, acetylfentanyl) are even more potent. Cross-contamination during production endangers entire drug supply. Most overdose deaths now involve fentanyl. Test strips essential for any street drugs.",

It produces intense euphoria, pain relief, and sedation, but carries extreme risks of addiction, overdose, and infectious disease transmission. The current street supply is heavily contaminated with fentanyl.",
        "origins": "Synthesized from morphine in 1874 by English chemist C.R. Alder Wright. Commercialized by Bayer pharmaceutical company in 1898 as a 'safer' morphine substitute and cough suppressant (tradename 'Heroin'). Quickly recognized as highly addictive and banned in most countries by the 1920s-30s. Illicit production now centered in Afghanistan, Mexico, and Southeast Asia.",
        "uses": "No current medical use in the United States (diamorphine still used medically in UK for severe pain). Historically used for pain, cough suppression, and as morphine substitute. Recreationally used for intense euphoria, pain relief, and escape. Routes: injection (IV), smoking, snorting. IV use carries highest overdose and infection risk.",
        "dangers": "Extremely high addiction potential—physical dependence develops rapidly. Overdose causes respiratory depression and death, especially with fentanyl contamination (now in majority of heroin supply). HIV, Hepatitis C transmission from shared needles. Collapsed veins, bacterial infections, abscesses from injection. Withdrawal is intensely uncomfortable but not typically fatal. Xylazine (tranq) increasingly found in supply, causes severe wounds and doesn't respond to naloxone. Unpredictable potency makes every dose potentially lethal.

Effects last only 5-15 minutes when smoked but are profoundly intense. Naturally occurs in many plants and trace amounts in human body.",
        "origins": "First synthesized in 1931 by Canadian chemist Richard Manske. Found in numerous plants used in South American shamanic ceremonies (ayahuasca brew contains DMT from Psychotria viridis). Modern Western use popularized by Terence McKenna's lectures in 1980s-90s. Known as 'the spirit molecule' from Rick Strassman's 1990s clinical research and subsequent book/documentary.",
        "uses": "Traditional: Ayahuasca ceremonies in South American indigenous cultures (DMT + MAOI from Banisteriopsis caapi vine). Modern: Brief but intense psychedelic experiences, spiritual exploration, entity contact reports. Research: Strassman's studies suggested potential for understanding consciousness. Recreational: 'Breakthrough' experiences, visual phenomena beyond other psychedelics. Typically smoked/vaporized for 5-15min effects or oral with MAOI for hours-long ayahuasca experience.",
        "dangers": "Overwhelming psychological intensity—can be terrifying for unprepared users. Risk of injury during experience due to complete dissociation from physical reality. Entities and alien landscapes can cause lasting existential confusion or fear. Extremely rapid onset (seconds) prevents gradual adaptation. Post-experience integration challenges. When used as ayahuasca (oral + MAOI), dangerous drug interactions: SSRIs, other antidepressants, stimulants, tyramine-rich foods can cause serotonin syndrome or hypertensive crisis. Pure DMT relatively safe physiologically but psychological impact profound. Not recommended for those with psychotic disorders or family history."

Risk of physical injury during experience (thrashing, falling). Should never be used standing or near hazards. Respiratory depression possible at high doses or combinations. Dangerous with MAOIs (serotonin syndrome, hypertensive crisis). Toad venom harvesting harms endangered species—synthetic preferred. Very difficult to distinguish from DMT by appearance—lab testing recommended. Psychological integration challenges post-experience. Can trigger lasting existential crisis or spiritual emergency.

        "overview": "Phencyclidine (PCP, angel dust) is a dissociative anesthetic developed in the 1950s but discontinued for human use due to severe psychological side effects. Produces dissociation, numbness, and at high doses, extreme agitation, violence, and psychosis. Notorious for unpredictable and dangerous behavior. Still used in veterinary medicine.",
        "origins": "Synthesized in 1926, developed as IV anesthetic (Sernyl) by Parke-Davis in 1950s. Human use discontinued in 1965 due to postoperative delirium and psychosis. Veterinary use continued until 1978. Became street drug in 1960s-70s, often misrepresented as THC, mescaline, or LSD. Less popular now than in 1970s-80s 'angel dust' era but still present in drug supply.",
        "uses": "No current legitimate medical use. Veterinary use discontinued. Illicitly used for dissociative effects, numbness, feeling of strength/invincibility. Sometimes unknowingly consumed when sold as other drugs. Can be smoked (often on mint, parsley), snorted, injected, or taken orally. Effects 4-6 hours (oral/snorted), 30min-1hour (smoked). Doses vary wildly due to illicit production.",
        "dangers": "Extremely unpredictable and dangerous. Notorious for violent, bizarre, self-destructive behavior. Superhuman strength feeling leads to severe injuries. Numbness prevents pain awareness—users have seriously injured themselves without realizing. Acute: Aggression, psychosis, seizures, hyperthermia, hypertensive crisis, coma, death. Chronic: Memory loss, speech difficulties, depression, suicidal ideation. Psychological addiction common. Horrible withdrawal. Can trigger lasting psychosis. Often found as adulterant in other drugs. Combining with other depressants extremely dangerous.",

        "overview": "Dextromethorphan (DXM) is an over-the-counter cough suppressant that produces dissociative and hallucinogenic effects at high doses. Found in many cough syrups and cold medications, it's one of the most accessible psychoactive substances. Effects are dose-dependent with distinct 'plateaus' of intensity, from mild euphoria to complete dissociation.",
        "origins": "Developed in the 1950s-60s as a safer, non-addictive alternative to codeine for cough suppression. FDA-approved and widely available OTC since 1958. Recreational use documented since the 1960s but became more popular in the 1990s-2000s with internet information sharing. Often extracted from cough syrups (cold water extraction) to avoid consuming harmful additives.",
        "uses": "Medical: Cough suppressant in cold/flu medications (Robitussin, NyQuil, Delsym). Typical therapeutic dose 15-30mg. Recreational: Dissociative effects, 'robo-tripping,' visual distortions, euphoria. Doses range from 100mg (first plateau) to 1500mg+ (fourth plateau, complete dissociation). Popular among teenagers due to legal accessibility. Some report antidepressant effects at low doses.",
        "dangers": "Serotonin syndrome risk, especially when combined with antidepressants (SSRIs, MAOIs). Respiratory depression at high doses. Nausea and vomiting common ('robo-itch'). Cough syrups contain dangerous additives: acetaminophen (liver damage), guaifenesin (nausea), antihistamines (dangerous combinations). Dissociation can lead to injury from falls or accidents. Tolerance develops rapidly with frequent use. Psychological addiction possible. Chronic abuse linked to brain lesions (Olney's lesions - debated). Some products contain high amounts of acetaminophen which can cause fatal liver failure at recreational DXM doses. Always check active ingredients carefully.",

One of the oldest known psychedelics, producing visual hallucinations, altered perception, and spiritual experiences similar to psilocybin and LSD but with a unique character. Effects last 10-12 hours with relatively gentle come-up and minimal body load compared to synthetic psychedelics.",
        "origins": "Used by indigenous peoples of Mexico and southwestern US for at least 5,700 years in religious ceremonies. Peyote central to Native American Church practices (legally protected for members). Isolated in 1897, synthesized in 1919. Studied by early psychedelic researchers in 1950s-60s. Aldous Huxley's 'The Doors of Perception' (1954) popularized mescaline experiences. Scheduled in 1970 but peyote use remains legal for Native American Church.",
        "uses": "Traditional: Sacred medicine in indigenous ceremonies, vision quests, healing rituals (peyote and San Pedro). Recreational: Visual hallucinations, introspection, nature connection, spiritual experiences. San Pedro cactus tea more common than peyote due to conservation concerns. Typical dose 200-400mg mescaline or equivalent cactus material. Duration 10-12 hours. Known for warm, empathogenic quality alongside psychedelic effects.",
        "dangers": "Physiologically very safe—no lethal dose established. Primary risks psychological: bad trips, anxiety, paranoia especially at high doses or unsafe settings. Nausea and vomiting common during come-up (traditional preparation includes purging as spiritual cleansing). Cactus preparations can cause more stomach discomfort than pure mescaline. Can trigger latent mental health conditions. Peyote endangered due to overharvesting—ethical concerns with non-traditional use. San Pedro more sustainable. Contraindicated with heart conditions (slight cardiovascular stimulation). Very long duration can be exhausting. Set and setting crucial. Legal status: mescaline Schedule I, but peyote legal for Native American Church, San Pedro often legal as ornamental cactus.",

        "overview": "Alprazolam (Xanax) is a fast-acting, potent benzodiazepine prescribed for anxiety and panic disorders. Produces relaxation, sedation, and anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) effects. One of the most prescribed and most abused benzos due to rapid onset and euphoric effects at higher doses. Street 'Xanax' pills frequently counterfeit and contain fentanyl, other benzos (flualprazolam, etizolam), or no active ingredient.",
        "origins": "Developed by Upjohn (now Pfizer) in late 1960s, FDA-approved 1981. Became one of most prescribed psychiatric medications in US. Short half-life (6-12 hours) makes it effective for acute anxiety but also increases addiction potential. Available in immediate-release tablets (0.25mg to 2mg) and extended-release (Xanax XR). 'Bars' (2mg) became street drug of choice in 2000s-2010s, often combined with opioids or alcohol.",
        "uses": "Medical: Anxiety disorders, panic disorder, anxiety associated with depression. Short-term use recommended due to tolerance and dependence. Rapid relief of acute anxiety/panic attacks. Recreational: Sedation, disinhibition, euphoria (at high doses), blackout experiences, combining with opioids or alcohol ('lean'). Popular in hip-hop culture. Pressed counterfeit pills widely available on street/dark web. Typical prescribed dose 0.25-2mg; recreational users often take 4-10mg+ leading to blackouts and dangerous behavior.",
        "dangers": "EXTREMELY ADDICTIVE—physical dependence develops within weeks. Withdrawal can be FATAL (seizures, delirium tremens)—requires medical supervision to safely discontinue. Blackouts and amnesia common at recreational doses leading to dangerous behavior, accidents, sexual assault. Combining with opioids or alcohol frequently FATAL (respiratory depression). Counterfeit 'Xanax' bars often contain fentanyl—numerous overdose deaths. Pressed pills may contain flualprazolam (longer-acting, more sedating RC benzo) or other research chemicals. Tolerance develops rapidly requiring higher doses. Cognitive impairment, motor coordination issues increase fall/accident risk. Paradoxical reactions possible (increased anxiety, aggression). Rebound anxiety when stopping. Elderly particularly vulnerable to falls, confusion, dementia-like symptoms. Reagent tests don't work on benzos—fentanyl test strips essential for any street pills.",

Duration of 18-36+ hours makes bad trips prolonged nightmares. Extremely dose-sensitive: difference between threshold and dangerous dose is tiny (200-800mcg range). Often mis-sold as 2C-B-FLY, LSD, or other psychedelics. Onset can take 2-6 hours, leading users to redose and overdose fatally. Physiological effects include extreme vasoconstriction, tissue damage, potential organ failure. Psychological effects: terror, confusion, psychosis lasting days. No antidote.

Weaker than morphine (codeine is a prodrug that converts to morphine in the liver). Found in prescription medications like Tylenol #3, cough syrups (promethazine-codeine), and standalone pills. Popular in 'lean' or 'purple drank' culture when mixed with soda and candy.",
        "origins": "Isolated from opium in 1832 by French chemist Pierre Robiquet. Widely used in medicine since late 1800s as safer alternative to morphine for mild pain. Included in over-the-counter cough syrups until stricter regulations in 1970s-90s. Hip-hop culture popularized 'lean' (codeine cough syrup + soda) in 1990s-2000s Houston scene, spreading nationally. Now Schedule II-V depending on formulation and concentration.",
        "uses": "Medical: Mild-moderate pain relief, cough suppression, diarrhea treatment. Often combined with acetaminophen (Tylenol #3) or aspirin. Typical dose 15-60mg for pain. Recreational: 'Lean' or 'purple drank' (codeine cough syrup + promethazine + soda + candy), euphoria, relaxation, nodding. Doses 60-120mg+ for recreational effects. Effects: 3-4 hours duration, less intense than other opioids but still addictive.",
        "dangers": "Addiction and physical dependence develop with regular use—opioid withdrawal includes muscle aches, anxiety, insomnia, nausea. Respiratory depression at high doses or when combined with other depressants (alcohol, benzos, promethazine). Acetaminophen toxicity—many codeine pills contain APAP which causes liver damage/failure at high doses (>4000mg daily). 'Lean' culture glamorizes dangerous behavior—multiple celebrity deaths (Pimp C, DJ Screw, Lil Peep used multiple substances). Genetic variation in CYP2D6 enzyme means some people convert codeine to morphine very efficiently (ultra-rapid metabolizers = overdose risk) while others get no effect (poor metabolizers). Constipation, nausea, itching common. Promethazine in cough syrup adds sedation and respiratory depression risk. Driving impairment. Gateway to stronger opioids for some users.",

        "overview": "Oxycodone is a semi-synthetic opioid analgesic prescribed for moderate to severe pain. Approximately 1.5x more potent than morphine. Available as immediate-release (Roxicodone, Percocet with acetaminophen) and extended-release (OxyContin). Extremely high abuse and diversion rates. The counterfeit 'M30' pills (fake oxycodone 30mg) are now the #1 cause of fentanyl overdose deaths—virtually all street M30s contain fentanyl, not oxycodone.",
        "origins": "Synthesized from thebaine (opium alkaloid) in 1916 by German chemists Martin Freund and Edmund Speyer. Introduced commercially in 1939. OxyContin (extended-release) launched by Purdue Pharma in 1996 with aggressive marketing claiming low addiction risk—this sparked the modern opioid epidemic. Purdue pled guilty to criminal charges in 2007 and 2020 for misleading marketing. By 2010s, pill mills and overprescribing led to epidemic of addiction and transition to heroin/fentanyl when prescriptions tightened. Now, counterfeit 'M30' pills are primary fentanyl delivery method.",
        "uses": "Medical: Moderate-severe pain (post-surgical, cancer, chronic pain). Typical dose 5-30mg every 4-6 hours for immediate-release; 10-80mg every 12 hours for OxyContin. Recreational/diverted: Pills crushed and snorted, chewed, or dissolved for injection to bypass extended-release mechanism. Euphoria, pain relief, sedation, 'nodding.' Street pills ('blues,' 'M30s,' 'roxies') almost universally counterfeit containing fentanyl.",
        "dangers": "COUNTERFEIT EPIDEMIC: The DEA reports 6 out of 10 fake M30 pills contain lethal fentanyl doses. If you didn't get it from YOUR prescription at a pharmacy, assume it's fake and contains fentanyl. Addiction develops rapidly—one of highest abuse potentials among opioids. Physical dependence and severe withdrawal. Respiratory depression and overdose, especially when combined with alcohol, benzos, or other depressants. Acetaminophen toxicity in Percocet formulations (liver damage/failure). Constipation, nausea, sedation. IV use carries infection risks. OxyContin abuse contributed to opioid epidemic and transition to heroin/fentanyl. Fake pills are manufactured by cartels with pill presses—look identical to real pills but contain fentanyl, carfentanil, or nothing.",

Much more potent than cocaine or methamphetamine. Causes intense stimulation, euphoria, paranoia, and hallucinations. Highly addictive with severe compulsive redosing. Active at 5-20mg doses. Associated with violent incidents, psychosis, and deaths. Largely replaced by alpha-PVP after scheduling but still encountered.",
        "origins": "First synthesized in 1969 by Boehringer Ingelheim as potential ADHD medication but never marketed. Remained obscure until 2000s research chemical scene. Exploded in popularity 2009-2011 as legal high sold as 'bath salts,' 'plant food,' or 'research chemicals' with labels 'not for human consumption.' Miami 'cannibal' incident (2012) falsely attributed to MDPV caused media panic (actually not MDPV but became face of bath salts crisis). Emergency scheduling 2011, Schedule I 2012.

Effects described as more intense than cocaine with longer duration. Binges lasting days common. Now rare due to scheduling and replacement by analogues.",

Cardiovascular toxicity: extreme tachycardia (>200 bpm reported), hypertension, vasoconstriction, cardiac arrest. Hyperthermia can be fatal. Compulsive redosing impossible to control—users report going through grams in sessions. Severe comedown: depression, exhaustion, suicidal ideation. Physical dependence and severe withdrawal. Multiple deaths documented. Violent incidents common—attacks on others, police encounters. Nasal damage from snorting. Often triggers psychotic breaks requiring psychiatric hospitalization.

        "overview": "Lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse) is a prodrug stimulant medication for ADHD and binge eating disorder. Converted to dextroamphetamine in the body after oral consumption. Longer-acting and smoother than immediate-release amphetamines. Designed to reduce abuse potential compared to Adderall. Now one of most prescribed ADHD medications. Common diversion for academic performance enhancement. Cannot be snorted or injected effectively (prodrug must be metabolized first).",
        "origins": "Developed by New River Pharmaceuticals (acquired by Shire, now Takeda) specifically to create an abuse-deterrent amphetamine formulation. FDA-approved 2007 for ADHD. Approved 2015 for binge eating disorder—first medication for this indication. Designed as 'pro-drug' that requires enzymatic conversion in blood to become active dextroamphetamine. This prevents rapid onset from snorting/injecting, theoretically reducing abuse. Now one of top prescribed ADHD medications, competing with Adderall. Schedule II controlled substance. Patent expired 2023, generics now available.",
        "uses": "Medical: ADHD treatment (children and adults), binge eating disorder. Typical dose 30-70mg once daily. Converted to d-amphetamine in body—30mg Vyvanse ≈ 10mg d-amphetamine. Effects last 10-14 hours (all-day coverage). Recreational/Academic: Cognitive enhancement, studying, increased focus and energy. Popular among college students. Some users still abuse despite prodrug design. Oral only—cannot be effectively snorted or injected. Lower 'rush' than Adderall makes it less preferred recreationally but still diverted.",
        "dangers": "Similar to amphetamine: Cardiovascular risks (increased HR/BP, risk of heart issues), abuse potential (lower than immediate-release stimulants but still significant), tolerance and psychological dependence, appetite suppression and weight loss, insomnia if taken too late, anxiety and irritability, potential for psychosis with chronic high-dose use. Prodrug design means delayed onset—some users take more thinking it's not working, leading to overdose when all doses convert. Mixing with other stimulants or alcohol dangerous. Withdrawal: fatigue, depression, hypersomnia. Cannot be 'rushed' like other stimulants—frustrates some abusers but doesn't eliminate abuse.",

Popular in UK and Europe.",
        "origins": "Synthesized 1964, marketed by Wyeth. FDA-approved 1981 for insomnia. Became one of most prescribed sleep medications. Schedule IV controlled substance. Gel capsule formulation notorious for IV abuse (especially UK in 1980s-90s)—formulation changed to reduce this. Generic widely available. Common in medical settings and diverted to street.",
        "uses": "Medical: Short-term insomnia treatment. Typical dose 7.5-30mg at bedtime. Duration 6-8 hours (good for full night sleep). Recreational/diverted: Sleep aid, sedation, anxiety relief, euphoria (especially IV—dangerous). Popular among those with opioid use disorder. IV abuse of gel caps historically significant problem. Often combined with opioids (deadly).",
        "dangers": "Physical dependence with regular use—withdrawal FATAL (seizures). Respiratory depression when combined with opioids, alcohol—many deaths. IV injection of gel caps extremely dangerous: thrombosis, gangrene, limb amputations reported (UK epidemic 1980s-90s). Blackouts, amnesia. 'Sleep-driving' and other complex behaviors while not fully awake. Tolerance develops. Hangover effects next day. Counterfeit pills may contain other substances.",

        "origins": "Traditional use by indigenous Amazonian peoples (Peru, Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia) for thousands of years. Used by shamans for healing, divination, spiritual work. Banisteriopsis caapi vine (MAOI) + Psychotria viridis leaves (DMT) traditional combination. Discovered by Western anthropologists mid-1900s. Popularized by Terence McKenna, Dennis McKenna, others. Now commercialized in ayahuasca tourism (controversial—exploitation concerns). Legal status varies: traditional use protected in some areas, prohibited in others. Churches like UDV and Santo Daime have religious exemptions in some countries.",
        "uses": "Traditional: Shamanic healing, spiritual guidance, divination, community ceremonies. Modern: Spiritual exploration, trauma healing, addiction treatment (some clinical research), personal growth. Duration 4-6 hours. Effects: intense visuals, emotional processing, purging (vomiting common—seen as cleansing), insights, mystical experiences. Often described as profoundly meaningful but difficult. Preparation (dieta) typically required in traditional contexts—dietary restrictions, abstinence, intention-setting.",
        "dangers": "MAOI INTERACTIONS: Ayahuasca contains MAOIs from B. caapi. DANGEROUS with: SSRIs/antidepressants (serotonin syndrome—potentially FATAL), stimulants (hypertensive crisis), tyramine-rich foods, many medications. Requires dietary restrictions 24hrs+ before/after. Intense purging (vomiting, diarrhea) very common. Psychologically challenging—can surface trauma, cause distressing experiences. Risk of triggering mental illness. Safety varies hugely by setting: traditional shamans vs. untrained facilitators vs. tourist traps. Reports of sexual abuse in ceremonies. Quality/potency varies wildly. Can cause hypertensive crisis, serotonin syndrome with wrong combinations. Contraindicated in pregnancy, heart conditions, mental health issues.",

At low doses, produces stimulant effects; at higher doses, opioid-like pain relief and sedation. Widely used for pain management, opioid withdrawal, and energy. Legal status varies by country and US state.",
        "origins": "Used traditionally in Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia for centuries by laborers to combat fatigue and manage pain. Leaves chewed fresh or brewed as tea. Western awareness grew in 1800s but remained obscure until 2000s internet commerce. Banned in Thailand (ironically, its origin) since 1943 but recently re-legalized. DEA attempted scheduling in 2016 but withdrew after public outcry. Currently unscheduled federally in US but banned in several states.",
        "uses": "Traditional: Energy, pain relief, treating diarrhea, wound healing. Modern: Self-treatment for chronic pain (alternative to prescription opioids), opioid withdrawal aid (reduces symptoms), anxiety and depression relief, energy and focus (low doses), recreational sedation (high doses). Strains: Red (sedating, pain relief), Green (balanced), White (energizing). Typical dose 2-5g (moderate) to 5-10g+ (strong). Often consumed as powder in capsules, 'toss and wash,' or tea.",
        "dangers": "Physical dependence and withdrawal with regular use—symptoms similar to mild opioid withdrawal (muscle aches, irritability, insomnia, runny nose). Tolerance develops, requiring increasing doses. Nausea and 'wobbles' (dizziness, nausea) common at high doses or with certain strains. Constipation (opioid effect). Liver toxicity rare but reported with chronic heavy use or adulterated products. Respiratory depression possible when combined with other CNS depressants (alcohol, benzos, opioids)—deaths almost always involve poly-drug use. Seizures reported in rare cases. Quality control issues: products may be contaminated with salmonella, heavy metals, or adulterated with actual opioids. Some extracts (shots, enhanced products) extremely potent. Addiction potential debated but real for some users. Can test positive for methadone on some drug tests (false positive).",

Growing concern as vendors sell concentrated 7-OH tablets, shots, and powders—much more addictive and dangerous than whole-leaf kratom.",
        "origins": "First isolated from kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) in 1990s research. Naturally occurs at ~0.01-0.04% in kratom leaves—tiny fraction compared to mitragynine (1-2%). Recent years saw development of extraction/concentration methods and even synthetic production. Sold at gas stations, smoke shops, online as 'enhanced kratom,' tablets, liquid shots. Marketed as legal opioid alternative. Not scheduled federally in US but banned in some states. FDA warnings issued about concentrated kratom products.",
        "uses": "No approved medical use. Marketed for: pain relief, opioid withdrawal, energy, mood enhancement. Typical concentrated product doses unclear—products vary wildly in content (10-100mg+ per dose reported). Effects: Strong opioid-like effects—analgesia, euphoria, sedation. Duration 4-6 hours. Much more potent than regular kratom powder. Used by some for managing opioid withdrawal but creates its own dependence.",
        "dangers": "MUCH MORE ADDICTIVE than whole-leaf kratom. Rapid physical dependence (days to weeks). Severe withdrawal syndrome—worse than regular kratom (flu-like symptoms, anxiety, insomnia, RLS for 1-2 weeks). Respiratory depression possible at high doses. May contain synthetic 7-OH or other adulterants—quality control issues. Dosing inconsistent between products—overdose risk. Constipation, nausea, dizziness. Liver toxicity concerns (case reports). Can precipitate withdrawal if used while on buprenorphine. Marketing to opioid-dependent individuals creates high-risk cycle. Deaths reported with combinations (alcohol, benzos).
