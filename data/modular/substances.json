      "overview": "3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), commonly known as ecstasy or molly, is an empathogen-entactogen that produces feelings of emotional openness, empathy, and euphoria. It's one of the most popular recreational drugs worldwide, particularly in dance and festival settings.",
      "origins": "First synthesized by Merck pharmaceutical company in 1912, MDMA remained obscure until the 1970s when chemist Alexander Shulgin resynthesized it and introduced it to psychotherapists. It gained popularity as a therapeutic tool before becoming a Schedule I controlled substance in 1985.",
      "uses": "Originally explored for marriage counseling and PTSD treatment in psychotherapy. Currently used recreationally for its prosocial effects, emotional warmth, and sensory enhancement. FDA-approved clinical trials are ongoing for PTSD-assisted therapy with promising results.",
      "dangers": "Neurotoxicity concerns with frequent use, especially at high doses or elevated body temperatures. Risk of hyperthermia, hyponatremia (water intoxication), serotonin syndrome. Often adulterated with methamphetamine, MDA, cathinones, or other stimulants. Increasing fentanyl contamination in pressed pills. Can cause short-term memory issues, depression, and anxiety in the days following use ('comedown').",

      "origins": "Synthesized in 1938 by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann at Sandoz Laboratories while researching ergot alkaloids. Its psychedelic properties were discovered accidentally in 1943 when Hofmann absorbed a small amount through his skin. Widely used in psychiatric research in the 1950s-60s before being scheduled in 1968.",
      "uses": "Historically used in psychotherapy for treating alcoholism, anxiety, and depression. Currently being researched for treatment of PTSD, anxiety, depression, and cluster headaches. Recreationally used for introspection, creativity enhancement, and transcendent experiences. Microdosing (sub-perceptual doses) popular for cognitive enhancement.",
      "dangers": "Psychological risks include 'bad trips,' anxiety, paranoia, and exacerbation of underlying mental health conditions. Rare but serious risk of persistent perceptual changes (HPPD). No physical addiction or toxicity, but psychologically intense. Primary danger is NBOMe compounds sold as LSD—these can be fatal and taste bitter/metallic. Real LSD is tasteless and causes tongue numbness only from ink/paper.",

Legal ambiguity: may be prosecuted as LSD analogue under analogue acts. Quality varies—some blotter contains other substances. Should still use Ehrlich reagent to confirm indole (will react same as LSD). Dosing more consistent than street LSD due to research chemical market quality control.

      "origins": "Synthesized by Alexander Shulgin and documented in TiHKAL #31. Not well-studied historically. Appeared on research chemical market around 2012-2013 but never gained widespread popularity. Less available than 1P-LSD or AL-LAD. Some users report it's virtually indistinguishable from LSD. Production and availability have been inconsistent.",
      "uses": "No medical use. Recreational: Effects very similar to LSD—visual hallucinations, altered perception, introspection. Typical dose 100-200mcg. Duration 8-10 hours. Less well-known and less available than other lysergamides. Some users specifically sought it during brief availability period. Reports suggest it may be slightly less potent than LSD but qualitatively similar. Rarely discussed due to limited availability.",
      "dangers": "Same psychological risks as LSD: bad trips, anxiety, triggering mental health conditions. Physiologically safe based on structural similarity to LSD. Less research than other lysergamides means fewer experience reports—dosing guidelines less certain. Quality highly variable due to limited production. Legal gray area. Should test with Ehrlich. Main issue is scarcity and lack of consistent information rather than inherent danger. Generally considered similar safety profile to LSD.",

      "overview": "Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic that causes a sense of detachment from one's body and environment. Known for producing 'k-holes' (profound dissociative states), dream-like experiences, and analgesia. It has a remarkable safety profile compared to other anesthetics and is experiencing a renaissance as a depression treatment.",
      "origins": "Synthesized in 1962 by Calvin Stevens at Parke-Davis as a safer alternative to PCP for anesthesia. Approved for medical use in 1970. Widely used in Vietnam War as battlefield anesthetic. Became popular in rave/club scenes in the 1990s. Recently FDA-approved as esketamine (Spravato) nasal spray for treatment-resistant depression.",
      "uses": "Medical: WHO Essential Medicine for anesthesia, especially in emergency/field medicine and pediatrics. Pain management, sedation, and recently for treatment-resistant depression. Veterinary medicine (common horse tranquilizer stereotype). Recreational: Dissociative experiences, psychedelic exploration, club/rave scenes. Therapeutic: Psychedelic-assisted therapy for depression, PTSD, anxiety, and addiction showing promising results.",
      "dangers": "Bladder damage (ulcerative cystitis) with chronic heavy use—can become severe and irreversible. Respiratory depression when combined with other depressants (alcohol, opioids, benzodiazepines). Risk of injury during dissociation due to impaired coordination and pain perception. Psychological dependence possible. 'K-holes' can be psychologically distressing for unprepared users. Cognitive impairment with chronic use. Often cut with synthetic cathinones or other dissociatives (2-FDCK, DCK). Street ketamine purity highly variable.",

      "overview": "Psilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in over 200 species of mushrooms ('magic mushrooms' or 'shrooms'). It produces profound alterations in perception, mood, thought, and sense of self. Psilocybin is considered one of the safest psychoactive substances with minimal toxicity and no addiction potential.",
      "origins": "Used in indigenous Mesoamerican spiritual and healing ceremonies for thousands of years. First isolated from Psilocybe mushrooms by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann (who also discovered LSD) in 1958. Popularized in Western culture by R. Gordon Wasson's 1957 Life Magazine article. Scheduled in 1970 despite therapeutic research. Recently decriminalized or legalized in several US cities and states.",
      "uses": "Traditional: Spiritual ceremonies, divination, healing rituals in indigenous cultures. Current research: Treatment for depression, anxiety (especially end-of-life), PTSD, addiction (smoking, alcohol), cluster headaches, and OCD with breakthrough results. Recreational: Introspection, nature connection, creative insights, mystical experiences. Microdosing: Sub-perceptual doses for mood, creativity, and focus enhancement.",
      "dangers": "Physiologically very safe—no lethal dose established, no organ toxicity. Primary risks are psychological: 'bad trips' with anxiety, paranoia, or terrifying experiences, especially in unsafe settings or high doses. Can trigger latent mental health conditions or exacerbate existing ones. HPPD (flashbacks) rare but possible. Mushroom misidentification can be fatal—only consume from trusted sources or expert identification. No physical addiction but psychological attachment possible. Set and setting crucial for positive experiences. Contraindicated with certain mental health conditions (schizophrenia, bipolar).",

Originally developed for pain management and anesthesia, it has become a major driver of overdose deaths when illicitly manufactured and mixed into other drugs without users' knowledge.",
      "origins": "Synthesized in 1959 by Belgian physician Paul Janssen as a surgical analgesic. Introduced medically in the 1960s for anesthesia and chronic pain management via patches and lozenges. Illicitly manufactured fentanyl (IMF) emerged in the 1970s but exploded in the 2010s, fueling the current opioid crisis.",
      "uses": "Medical: Prescribed as transdermal patches (Duragesic), lozenges (Actiq), or IV anesthesia for severe pain and surgical procedures. Cancer patients and chronic pain management. Illicitly: Added to heroin to increase potency, pressed into counterfeit pills (fake oxycodone, Xanax), or mixed into cocaine, meth, and MDMA as adulterant.",
      "dangers": "EXTREMELY HIGH OVERDOSE RISK: 2mg (size of few grains of salt) can be lethal. Respiratory depression occurs within seconds to minutes. Naloxone (Narcan) required immediately for overdose reversal—may need multiple doses. Increasingly found in non-opioid drugs causing unexpected overdoses. Analogues (carfentanil, acetylfentanyl) are even more potent. Cross-contamination during production endangers entire drug supply. Most overdose deaths now involve fentanyl.

The current street supply is heavily contaminated with fentanyl.",
      "origins": "Synthesized from morphine in 1874 by English chemist C.R. Alder Wright. Commercialized by Bayer pharmaceutical company in 1898 as a 'safer' morphine substitute and cough suppressant (tradename 'Heroin'). Quickly recognized as highly addictive and banned in most countries by the 1920s-30s. Illicit production now centered in Afghanistan, Mexico, and Southeast Asia.",
      "uses": "No current medical use in the United States (diamorphine still used medically in UK for severe pain). Historically used for pain, cough suppression, and as morphine substitute. Recreationally used for intense euphoria, pain relief, and escape. Routes: injection (IV), smoking, snorting. IV use carries highest overdose and infection risk.",
      "dangers": "Extremely high addiction potential—physical dependence develops rapidly. Overdose causes respiratory depression and death, especially with fentanyl contamination (now in majority of heroin supply). HIV, Hepatitis C transmission from shared needles. Collapsed veins, bacterial infections, abscesses from injection. Withdrawal is intensely uncomfortable but not typically fatal. Xylazine (tranq) increasingly found in supply, causes severe wounds and doesn't respond to naloxone. Unpredictable potency makes every dose potentially lethal.

Effects last only 5-15 minutes when smoked but are profoundly intense. Naturally occurs in many plants and trace amounts in human body.",
      "origins": "First synthesized in 1931 by Canadian chemist Richard Manske. Found in numerous plants used in South American shamanic ceremonies (ayahuasca brew contains DMT from Psychotria viridis). Modern Western use popularized by Terence McKenna's lectures in 1980s-90s. Known as 'the spirit molecule' from Rick Strassman's 1990s clinical research and subsequent book/documentary.",
      "uses": "Traditional: Ayahuasca ceremonies in South American indigenous cultures (DMT + MAOI from Banisteriopsis caapi vine). Modern: Brief but intense psychedelic experiences, spiritual exploration, entity contact reports. Research: Strassman's studies suggested potential for understanding consciousness. Recreational: 'Breakthrough' experiences, visual phenomena beyond other psychedelics. Typically smoked/vaporized for 5-15min effects or oral with MAOI for hours-long ayahuasca experience.",
      "dangers": "Overwhelming psychological intensity—can be terrifying for unprepared users. Risk of injury during experience due to complete dissociation from physical reality. Entities and alien landscapes can cause lasting existential confusion or fear. Extremely rapid onset (seconds) prevents gradual adaptation. Post-experience integration challenges. When used as ayahuasca (oral + MAOI), dangerous drug interactions: SSRIs, other antidepressants, stimulants, tyramine-rich foods can cause serotonin syndrome or hypertensive crisis. Pure DMT relatively safe physiologically but psychological impact profound. Not recommended for those with psychotic disorders or family history."

      "overview": "5-Methoxy-N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) is an extremely potent, fast-acting psychedelic tryptamine distinct from DMT. Produces intense ego dissolution, unity experiences, and 'white light' phenomena rather than DMT's colorful visuals and entities. Naturally found in various plants and Colorado River toad (Bufo alvarius) venom. Effects last 15-45 minutes but feel timeless. Considered one of the most powerful psychedelics.",
      "origins": "Isolated from plant sources in 1936. Found in Bufo alvarius (Sonoran Desert toad) venom in 1965. Synthetic version available. Traditional use by indigenous South American tribes in yopo snuff (Anadenanthera). Modern use popularized by ethnobotanist Jonathan Ott and later by 'toad smoking' phenomenon. Not as culturally widespread as DMT or ayahuasca. Recently scheduled in many countries but research ongoing.",
      "uses": "Traditional: Yopo snuff ceremonies. Modern: Ego death experiences, mystical/spiritual exploration, therapeutic potential for trauma/addiction. Some report life-changing realizations and healing. Effects: Complete dissolution of self, unity with universe, 'white light,' profound peace or terror depending on set/setting. Minimal visuals compared to DMT—more about internal experience. Duration 15-45 minutes when smoked/vaporized. Typical dose 5-20mg (extremely potent). Sometimes used in therapeutic contexts but requires experienced facilitation.",
      "dangers": "EXTREMELY INTENSE—overwhelming even for experienced psychedelic users. Can be terrifying if unprepared—complete ego death with no frame of reference. Risk of physical injury during experience (thrashing, falling). Should never be used standing or near hazards. Respiratory depression possible at high doses or combinations. Dangerous with MAOIs (serotonin syndrome, hypertensive crisis). Toad venom harvesting harms endangered species—synthetic preferred. Very difficult to distinguish from DMT by appearance—lab testing recommended. Psychological integration challenges post-experience. Can trigger lasting existential crisis or spiritual emergency. Contraindicated for heart conditions (cardiovascular stress). Not for recreational use—requires serious intention and safe setting. Reports of deaths from improper use or combinations."

      "overview": "Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is a CNS depressant that occurs naturally in the human body in trace amounts. As a drug, it produces euphoria, relaxation, and sociability at low doses, but has an extremely narrow margin between desired effects and overdose. Commonly known as a 'date rape drug' though most use is voluntary. Liquid form makes dosing dangerous.",
      "origins": "Synthesized in 1874, developed as an anesthetic in 1960s but abandoned due to side effects. Used by bodybuilders in 1980s for alleged growth hormone release and sleep enhancement. Became popular club drug in 1990s. Scheduled as Schedule I (illicit) in 2000 but Schedule III when prescribed as Xyrem for narcolepsy. Precursors GBL and 1,4-BD legal in many areas and convert to GHB in body.",
      "uses": "Medical: Xyrem (sodium oxybate) prescribed for narcolepsy with cataplexy. Rare use as anesthetic in some countries. Recreational: Euphoria, disinhibition, enhanced sociability and sexuality. Popular in club/rave scenes and 'chemsex' contexts. Bodybuilding: Claimed (unproven) benefits for muscle growth and recovery. Typical dose 1-2.5g but highly variable by concentration. Duration 1.5-3 hours.",
      "dangers": "EXTREME OVERDOSE RISK: Very narrow therapeutic window. Difference between desired effects and unconsciousness can be <1g. Sudden onset—conscious to unconscious in minutes. Respiratory depression, vomiting while unconscious (aspiration risk), seizures. No antidote—supportive care only. Combining with alcohol is extremely dangerous and often fatal. Physical dependence develops quickly with regular use. Withdrawal can be life-threatening (similar to alcohol). Liquid form makes accurate dosing nearly impossible. Concentration varies wildly between batches. Used in drug-facilitated sexual assault. Memory impairment and blackouts common. Chronic use linked to cognitive impairment. GBL and 1,4-BD (precursors) are even more dangerous due to unpredictable conversion rates.",

Often extracted from cough syrups (cold water extraction) to avoid consuming harmful additives.",
      "uses": "Medical: Cough suppressant in cold/flu medications (Robitussin, NyQuil, Delsym). Typical therapeutic dose 15-30mg. Recreational: Dissociative effects, 'robo-tripping,' visual distortions, euphoria. Doses range from 100mg (first plateau) to 1500mg+ (fourth plateau, complete dissociation). Popular among teenagers due to legal accessibility. Some report antidepressant effects at low doses.",
      "dangers": "Serotonin syndrome risk, especially when combined with antidepressants (SSRIs, MAOIs). Respiratory depression at high doses. Nausea and vomiting common ('robo-itch'). Cough syrups contain dangerous additives: acetaminophen (liver damage), guaifenesin (nausea), antihistamines (dangerous combinations). Dissociation can lead to injury from falls or accidents. Tolerance develops rapidly with frequent use. Psychological addiction possible. Chronic abuse linked to brain lesions (Olney's lesions - debated). Some products contain high amounts of acetaminophen which can cause fatal liver failure at recreational DXM doses. Always check active ingredients carefully.",

Effects last 10-12 hours with relatively gentle come-up and minimal body load compared to synthetic psychedelics.",
      "origins": "Used by indigenous peoples of Mexico and southwestern US for at least 5,700 years in religious ceremonies. Peyote central to Native American Church practices (legally protected for members). Isolated in 1897, synthesized in 1919. Studied by early psychedelic researchers in 1950s-60s. Aldous Huxley's 'The Doors of Perception' (1954) popularized mescaline experiences. Scheduled in 1970 but peyote use remains legal for Native American Church.",
      "uses": "Traditional: Sacred medicine in indigenous ceremonies, vision quests, healing rituals (peyote and San Pedro). Recreational: Visual hallucinations, introspection, nature connection, spiritual experiences. San Pedro cactus tea more common than peyote due to conservation concerns. Typical dose 200-400mg mescaline or equivalent cactus material. Duration 10-12 hours. Known for warm, empathogenic quality alongside psychedelic effects.",
      "dangers": "Physiologically very safe—no lethal dose established. Primary risks psychological: bad trips, anxiety, paranoia especially at high doses or unsafe settings. Nausea and vomiting common during come-up (traditional preparation includes purging as spiritual cleansing). Cactus preparations can cause more stomach discomfort than pure mescaline. Can trigger latent mental health conditions. Peyote endangered due to overharvesting—ethical concerns with non-traditional use. San Pedro more sustainable. Contraindicated with heart conditions (slight cardiovascular stimulation). Very long duration can be exhausting. Set and setting crucial. Legal status: mescaline Schedule I, but peyote legal for Native American Church, San Pedro often legal as ornamental cactus.",

      "overview": "Alprazolam (Xanax) is a fast-acting, potent benzodiazepine prescribed for anxiety and panic disorders. Produces relaxation, sedation, and anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) effects. One of the most prescribed and most abused benzos due to rapid onset and euphoric effects at higher doses. Street 'Xanax' pills frequently counterfeit and contain fentanyl, other benzos (flualprazolam, etizolam), or no active ingredient.",
      "origins": "Developed by Upjohn (now Pfizer) in late 1960s, FDA-approved 1981. Became one of most prescribed psychiatric medications in US. Short half-life (6-12 hours) makes it effective for acute anxiety but also increases addiction potential. Available in immediate-release tablets (0.25mg to 2mg) and extended-release (Xanax XR). 'Bars' (2mg) became street drug of choice in 2000s-2010s, often combined with opioids or alcohol.",
      "uses": "Medical: Anxiety disorders, panic disorder, anxiety associated with depression. Short-term use recommended due to tolerance and dependence. Rapid relief of acute anxiety/panic attacks. Recreational: Sedation, disinhibition, euphoria (at high doses), blackout experiences, combining with opioids or alcohol ('lean'). Popular in hip-hop culture. Pressed counterfeit pills widely available on street/dark web. Typical prescribed dose 0.25-2mg; recreational users often take 4-10mg+ leading to blackouts and dangerous behavior.",
      "dangers": "EXTREMELY ADDICTIVE—physical dependence develops within weeks. Withdrawal can be FATAL (seizures, delirium tremens)—requires medical supervision to safely discontinue. Blackouts and amnesia common at recreational doses leading to dangerous behavior, accidents, sexual assault. Combining with opioids or alcohol frequently FATAL (respiratory depression). Counterfeit 'Xanax' bars often contain fentanyl—numerous overdose deaths. Pressed pills may contain flualprazolam (longer-acting, more sedating RC benzo) or other research chemicals. Tolerance develops rapidly requiring higher doses. Cognitive impairment, motor coordination issues increase fall/accident risk. Paradoxical reactions possible (increased anxiety, aggression). Rebound anxiety when stopping. Elderly particularly vulnerable to falls, confusion, dementia-like symptoms. Reagent tests don't work on benzos—fentanyl test strips essential for any street pills.",

Remains available but rare.",
      "uses": "No medical use. Recreational: Intense, extremely long-lasting psychedelic experiences. Effects can persist 24-36 hours or longer. Some users sought it for its unique visual and mental effects, but extreme duration, narrow dosing window, and severe dangers have made it highly discouraged by harm reduction communities. Often consumed unknowingly when sold as safer substances.",

Duration of 18-36+ hours makes bad trips prolonged nightmares. Extremely dose-sensitive: difference between threshold and dangerous dose is tiny (200-800mcg range). Often mis-sold as 2C-B-FLY, LSD, or other psychedelics. Onset can take 2-6 hours, leading users to redose and overdose fatally. Physiological effects include extreme vasoconstriction, tissue damage, potential organ failure. Psychological effects: terror, confusion, psychosis lasting days. No antidote.

Extremely addictive with life-threatening withdrawal. One of most dangerous research chemical benzos.",
      "origins": "Research chemical first appearing on online markets around 2017-2018. Never approved for medical use. Specifically designed as more potent Xanax alternative. Rapidly gained popularity in RC benzo scene. Frequently pressed into fake Xanax bars (often alongside etizolam or fentanyl). Seized in large quantities by law enforcement. Emergency scheduling in many jurisdictions 2020-2021. China production. Still widely available despite scheduling. Became notorious for extreme blackouts and dangerous behavior.",

Typical dose 0.5-1mg (very potent—compare to Xanax 1-2mg). Duration 8-12 hours. Mostly consumed unknowingly in fake Xanax bars. Intentional use among RC benzo community. Extreme blackouts common—users report losing entire days. Compulsive redosing while blacked out. Often combined with opioids (deadly). Popular in addiction and poly-substance use contexts.",

Compulsive redosing during blackouts leads to massive doses. Respiratory depression when combined with opioids/alcohol—FATAL. Physical dependence develops extremely rapidly. Withdrawal can be FATAL—seizures, delirium, death. NEVER stop cold turkey—medical taper required. Disinhibition causes dangerous, criminal behavior. Found in fake Xanax bars—users don't know dosage or what they're taking. Often contains fentanyl as well. Tolerance builds fast. Harm reduction nearly impossible due to blackout potential.",

Addiction potential severely underestimated by users.",
      "origins": "Developed in 1960s Soviet Union for cosmonauts to reduce stress without sedation impairment. Prescription medication in Russia, Latvia, Ukraine (trade names: Noofen, Anvifen). Remains unscheduled in US, UK, and most Western countries. Sold as dietary supplement despite not being approved by FDA. Became popular in nootropic/biohacking communities in 2010s. Reddit, Longecity forums popularized use.",
      "uses": "Medical (in Russia): Anxiety disorders, insomnia, PTSD, alcohol withdrawal. Typical dose 250-1000mg. Supplement use: Anxiety relief, social anxiety reduction, sleep aid, mood enhancement. Some users report improved sociability and reduced social inhibition (similar to alcohol but without intoxication). Popular for public speaking, dates, interviews. Effects: 2-4 hours onset, 15-24 hour duration. Recreational: Euphoria at higher doses (2-3g+), combining with alcohol or other drugs (dangerous).",

Withdrawal can be DANGEROUS: seizures, psychosis, hallucinations, severe anxiety, insomnia, agitation. Withdrawal worse than many report—can last weeks. Tolerance develops rapidly requiring dose escalation. Long half-life (5-6 hours) but effects last much longer—easy to redose and overdose. Combining with alcohol or other depressants dangerous (respiratory depression). Liver toxicity possible with chronic use. Very difficult to quit once dependent—requires slow taper (months). Rebound anxiety severe. Highly variable individual response—some very sensitive. Sold with minimal warnings about addiction potential. Users often don't realize they're dependent until they try to stop. Not detected on standard drug tests. Quality varies between suppliers—heavy metal contamination possible.

Some users prefer benzofurans for longer-lasting experiences; others find duration exhausting.",
      "dangers": "Very long duration can be physically and mentally exhausting. Cardiovascular stress: increased heart rate and blood pressure over extended period. Vasoconstriction. Serotonin depletion worse than MDMA due to longer duration—severe comedown depression possible. Neurotoxicity concerns similar to MDMA but less studied. Jaw clenching, eye wiggling (nystagmus), overheating risk. Difficult to sleep for 12-18 hours after dosing. Higher doses produce intense psychedelic effects that can be overwhelming. Limited research on long-term effects. Sold as MDMA or mixed into pills—always test. Reagent reactions similar to MDMA but distinguishable with multiple reagents. Tolerance develops; cross-tolerance with MDMA. Recommended waiting period 3+ months between uses like MDMA.",

Included in over-the-counter cough syrups until stricter regulations in 1970s-90s. Hip-hop culture popularized 'lean' (codeine cough syrup + soda) in 1990s-2000s Houston scene, spreading nationally. Now Schedule II-V depending on formulation and concentration.",

Recreational: 'Lean' or 'purple drank' (codeine cough syrup + promethazine + soda + candy), euphoria, relaxation, nodding. Doses 60-120mg+ for recreational effects. Effects: 3-4 hours duration, less intense than other opioids but still addictive.",
      "dangers": "Addiction and physical dependence develop with regular use—opioid withdrawal includes muscle aches, anxiety, insomnia, nausea. Respiratory depression at high doses or when combined with other depressants (alcohol, benzos, promethazine). Acetaminophen toxicity—many codeine pills contain APAP which causes liver damage/failure at high doses (>4000mg daily). 'Lean' culture glamorizes dangerous behavior—multiple celebrity deaths (Pimp C, DJ Screw, Lil Peep used multiple substances). Genetic variation in CYP2D6 enzyme means some people convert codeine to morphine very efficiently (ultra-rapid metabolizers = overdose risk) while others get no effect (poor metabolizers).

The counterfeit 'M30' pills (fake oxycodone 30mg) are now the #1 cause of fentanyl overdose deaths—virtually all street M30s contain fentanyl, not oxycodone.",
      "origins": "Synthesized from thebaine (opium alkaloid) in 1916 by German chemists Martin Freund and Edmund Speyer. Introduced commercially in 1939. OxyContin (extended-release) launched by Purdue Pharma in 1996 with aggressive marketing claiming low addiction risk—this sparked the modern opioid epidemic. Purdue pled guilty to criminal charges in 2007 and 2020 for misleading marketing. By 2010s, pill mills and overprescribing led to epidemic of addiction and transition to heroin/fentanyl when prescriptions tightened. Now, counterfeit 'M30' pills are primary fentanyl delivery method.",
      "uses": "Medical: Moderate-severe pain (post-surgical, cancer, chronic pain). Typical dose 5-30mg every 4-6 hours for immediate-release; 10-80mg every 12 hours for OxyContin. Recreational/diverted: Pills crushed and snorted, chewed, or dissolved for injection to bypass extended-release mechanism. Euphoria, pain relief, sedation, 'nodding.' Street pills ('blues,' 'M30s,' 'roxies') almost universally counterfeit containing fentanyl.",
      "dangers": "COUNTERFEIT EPIDEMIC: The DEA reports 6 out of 10 fake M30 pills contain lethal fentanyl doses. If you didn't get it from YOUR prescription at a pharmacy, assume it's fake and contains fentanyl. Addiction develops rapidly—one of highest abuse potentials among opioids. Physical dependence and severe withdrawal. Respiratory depression and overdose, especially when combined with alcohol, benzos, or other depressants. Acetaminophen toxicity in Percocet formulations (liver damage/failure). Constipation, nausea, sedation. IV use carries infection risks. OxyContin abuse contributed to opioid epidemic and transition to heroin/fentanyl. Fake pills are manufactured by cartels with pill presses—look identical to real pills but contain fentanyl, carfentanil, or nothing.",

Vicodin (hydrocodone + acetaminophen) launched in 1978 and became one of most prescribed medications in America. Originally Schedule III but rescheduled to Schedule II in 2014 due to abuse epidemic. Tighter prescribing regulations led to decline in legitimate prescriptions but increase in counterfeit pills containing fentanyl.",
      "uses": "Medical: Moderate pain (dental procedures, injuries, post-surgical), cough suppression. Typical dose 5-10mg hydrocodone combined with 300-325mg acetaminophen (Norco 5/325, 10/325). Recreational: Euphoria, pain relief, relaxation, 'nodding.' Pills often taken in excess or combined with alcohol. Some users extract hydrocodone from acetaminophen ('cold water extraction') to avoid liver damage at high doses.",
      "dangers": "Addiction and physical dependence common—opioid withdrawal includes muscle aches, anxiety, insomnia, nausea, sweating. Respiratory depression and overdose, especially when combined with alcohol, benzodiazepines, or other CNS depressants. Acetaminophen toxicity—exceeding 4000mg daily causes liver damage and potential liver failure (fatal). Many deaths from Vicodin abuse involve acetaminophen overdose in addition to opioid effects.

Patent expired 2023, generics now available.",

Effects last 10-14 hours (all-day coverage). Recreational/Academic: Cognitive enhancement, studying, increased focus and energy. Popular among college students. Some users still abuse despite prodrug design. Oral only—cannot be effectively snorted or injected. Lower 'rush' than Adderall makes it less preferred recreationally but still diverted.",

Prodrug design means delayed onset—some users take more thinking it's not working, leading to overdose when all doses convert. Mixing with other stimulants or alcohol dangerous. Withdrawal: fatigue, depression, hypersomnia. Cannot be 'rushed' like other stimulants—frustrates some abusers but doesn't eliminate abuse.",

Psychosis, paranoia, confusion. 'Hole' experiences can be terrifying and last hours. Extremely dangerous when combined with other depressants (alcohol, benzos, opioids)—respiratory depression, death. Stimulant effects mask sedation—users don't realize how intoxicated they are. Tolerance develops quickly. Addiction potential. Deaths reported from overdose and accidents while intoxicated.

The prototypical opioid—all other opioids are compared to morphine for potency. Used medically for severe pain (post-surgical, cancer, trauma). Available as immediate-release and extended-release (MS Contin). Highly addictive with severe physical dependence. Standard pharmaceutical opioid but also diverted for recreational use. Less common on street than oxycodone/heroin due to lower oral bioavailability.",
      "origins": "Isolated from opium in 1804 by German pharmacist Friedrich Sertürner, making it the first active alkaloid extracted from a plant. Named after Morpheus, Greek god of dreams. Revolutionized pain management in medicine. Widely used in 1800s, including during American Civil War (created many addicts). Injectable morphine introduced mid-1800s. Recognized as highly addictive by early 1900s. Controlled substance since 1914 Harrison Narcotics Act. Still gold standard for severe pain management. Oral morphine (immediate and extended-release) and IV morphine standard in hospitals.",

MS Contin (extended-release) 15-200mg every 8-12 hours. Recreational: Euphoria, pain relief, sedation, 'nodding.' Less preferred recreationally than oxycodone due to poor oral bioavailability (~30%). IV/IM injection more effective but carries infection risks. Street use less common than heroin or oxycodone.",
      "dangers": "Severe addiction and physical dependence—withdrawal includes severe muscle aches, anxiety, insomnia, vomiting, diarrhea. Respiratory depression—fatal overdose, especially when combined with alcohol, benzos, or other CNS depressants. Constipation (severe, chronic). Nausea and vomiting common. Tolerance develops rapidly—requires increasing doses. IV use carries infection risks (HIV, Hep C, bacterial endocarditis). Hypotension, sedation, cognitive impairment. Driving extremely dangerous.

      "overview": "Lorazepam (Ativan) is a pharmaceutical benzodiazepine prescribed for anxiety, insomnia, and seizures. Intermediate-acting (10-20 hour half-life). More potent than diazepam—1mg lorazepam ≈ 10mg diazepam. Common in medical settings for acute anxiety and seizure control. High abuse potential. Physical dependence develops rapidly. Dangerous withdrawal can be fatal. Frequently diverted for recreational use and combined with opioids (deadly).",
      "origins": "Developed by DJ Richards for Wyeth Pharmaceuticals. Patent filed 1963, FDA-approved 1977 for anxiety disorders. Became one of most prescribed benzos by 1980s-90s. Widely used in hospitals for acute anxiety, alcohol withdrawal, seizures. Schedule IV controlled substance. Now generic and widely available. Common diversion and black market sales. Often prescribed long-term despite recommendations for short-term use only.",
      "uses": "Medical: Anxiety disorders, panic attacks, insomnia, acute seizures, alcohol withdrawal, pre-surgical sedation, chemotherapy-induced nausea. Typical dose 0.5-2mg for anxiety, 2-4mg for insomnia. Recreational/diverted: Anxiety relief, sedation, euphoria (some users), sleep aid, potentiating opioids (dangerous), comedown management from stimulants. Often combined with alcohol (very dangerous). Duration 6-8 hours.",
      "dangers": "SEVERE ADDICTION: Physical dependence develops in weeks of daily use. Withdrawal can be FATAL—seizures, delirium tremens, psychosis. NEVER stop abruptly—medical taper required. Respiratory depression when combined with opioids, alcohol, or other CNS depressants—many deaths. Memory impairment, cognitive dysfunction, paradoxical anxiety. Blackouts and amnesia at higher doses. Rebound anxiety worse than original. Tolerance develops rapidly. Disinhibition leads to risky behavior. Extremely dangerous driving impairment. Often diverted—counterfeit Ativan may contain other benzos or fentanyl. Elderly at higher risk for falls, confusion. Long-term use linked to dementia.",

FALLS AND INJURIES: Dissociation causes loss of balance—never use while standing. Deaths from falling. FROSTBITE: Direct inhalation from charger or tank causes severe frostbite to mouth, throat, lungs. ALWAYS use balloon. Tank use especially dangerous—can deliver too much pressure.

Likely metabolizes to psilocin (4-HO-DMT) in the body, producing nearly identical effects to magic mushrooms. Duration 4-6 hours. Extremely popular as legal psilocybin alternative. Described as indistinguishable from mushrooms by many users. Easier to dose precisely than mushrooms.",
      "origins": "First synthesized by Albert Hofmann (LSD discoverer) at Sandoz 1963, documented in patents but not developed. Remained obscure until 2000s research chemical boom. Gained massive popularity 2010-present as most accurate legal psilocybin substitute. Widely available on research chemical markets. Legal status varies—unscheduled in many countries, banned in some (UK 2017). Chinese and European labs produce it. Considered best psilocybin RC by many users.",
      "uses": "No medical use. Recreational/therapeutic: Identical to psilocybin mushrooms—introspection, emotional processing, visual effects, mystical experiences, nature connection. Typical dose 15-25mg (equivalent to 2-3g mushrooms). Duration 4-6 hours. Used for same purposes as mushrooms: spiritual exploration, therapy, creativity, recreation. Advantage: Precise dosing (powder/capsules) vs variable mushroom potency. Many users prefer it to mushrooms for consistency.",
      "dangers": "Same as psilocybin: Anxiety, paranoia, bad trips (psychological distress), confusion, disorientation. Nausea common. Not physically dangerous but psychologically intense. Can trigger latent psychosis in predisposed individuals. Not suitable for people with personal/family history of psychotic disorders. Challenging experiences possible—requires proper set and setting. Cross-tolerance with psilocybin, LSD, and other tryptamines. Impaired judgment—dangerous behavior possible. Long-term effects unknown but presumed similar to psilocybin.",

      "overview": "Ayahuasca is a traditional Amazonian plant brew combining DMT-containing plants (usually Psychotria viridis) with MAOI-containing plants (Banisteriopsis caapi vine). MAOIs make DMT orally active. Produces 4-6 hour visionary experiences. Used ceremonially by indigenous peoples for millennia. Increasingly popular in Western ayahuasca tourism and neo-shamanic ceremonies. Potentially therapeutic but carries significant risks.",
      "origins": "Traditional use by indigenous Amazonian peoples (Peru, Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia) for thousands of years. Used by shamans for healing, divination, spiritual work. Banisteriopsis caapi vine (MAOI) + Psychotria viridis leaves (DMT) traditional combination. Discovered by Western anthropologists mid-1900s. Popularized by Terence McKenna, Dennis McKenna, others. Now commercialized in ayahuasca tourism (controversial—exploitation concerns). Legal status varies: traditional use protected in some areas, prohibited in others. Churches like UDV and Santo Daime have religious exemptions in some countries.",
      "uses": "Traditional: Shamanic healing, spiritual guidance, divination, community ceremonies. Modern: Spiritual exploration, trauma healing, addiction treatment (some clinical research), personal growth. Duration 4-6 hours. Effects: intense visuals, emotional processing, purging (vomiting common—seen as cleansing), insights, mystical experiences. Often described as profoundly meaningful but difficult. Preparation (dieta) typically required in traditional contexts—dietary restrictions, abstinence, intention-setting.",
      "dangers": "MAOI INTERACTIONS: Ayahuasca contains MAOIs from B. caapi. DANGEROUS with: SSRIs/antidepressants (serotonin syndrome—potentially FATAL), stimulants (hypertensive crisis), tyramine-rich foods, many medications. Requires dietary restrictions 24hrs+ before/after. Intense purging (vomiting, diarrhea) very common. Psychologically challenging—can surface trauma, cause distressing experiences. Risk of triggering mental illness. Safety varies hugely by setting: traditional shamans vs. untrained facilitators vs. tourist traps. Reports of sexual abuse in ceremonies. Quality/potency varies wildly. Can cause hypertensive crisis, serotonin syndrome with wrong combinations. Contraindicated in pregnancy, heart conditions, mental health issues.",

Legal status varies by country and US state.",
      "origins": "Used traditionally in Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia for centuries by laborers to combat fatigue and manage pain. Leaves chewed fresh or brewed as tea. Western awareness grew in 1800s but remained obscure until 2000s internet commerce. Banned in Thailand (ironically, its origin) since 1943 but recently re-legalized. DEA attempted scheduling in 2016 but withdrew after public outcry. Currently unscheduled federally in US but banned in several states.",
      "uses": "Traditional: Energy, pain relief, treating diarrhea, wound healing. Modern: Self-treatment for chronic pain (alternative to prescription opioids), opioid withdrawal aid (reduces symptoms), anxiety and depression relief, energy and focus (low doses), recreational sedation (high doses). Strains: Red (sedating, pain relief), Green (balanced), White (energizing). Typical dose 2-5g (moderate) to 5-10g+ (strong). Often consumed as powder in capsules, 'toss and wash,' or tea.",
      "dangers": "Physical dependence and withdrawal with regular use—symptoms similar to mild opioid withdrawal (muscle aches, irritability, insomnia, runny nose). Tolerance develops, requiring increasing doses. Nausea and 'wobbles' (dizziness, nausea) common at high doses or with certain strains. Constipation (opioid effect). Liver toxicity rare but reported with chronic heavy use or adulterated products. Respiratory depression possible when combined with other CNS depressants (alcohol, benzos, opioids)—deaths almost always involve poly-drug use. Seizures reported in rare cases. Quality control issues: products may be contaminated with salmonella, heavy metals, or adulterated with actual opioids. Some extracts (shots, enhanced products) extremely potent. Addiction potential debated but real for some users. Can test positive for methadone on some drug tests (false positive).",
