## Why Privacy Matters

We understand that:

- 🔒 **Privacy enables safety** - People need access to harm reduction info without fear
- ⚖️ **Stigma is real** - Substance use is heavily stigmatized and sometimes criminalized
- 🏥 **Health comes first** - People shouldn't choose between privacy and safety

**That's why we built Dose Doctor with zero tracking.**
