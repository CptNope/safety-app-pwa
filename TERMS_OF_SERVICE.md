## Important Harm Reduction Reminders

⚠️ **Always use multiple reagent tests** - No single test is definitive

⚠️ **Lab testing (GC/MS) provides definitive results** - Use DrugsData, WEDINOS, or other professional services

⚠️ **Test every batch** - Same appearance ≠ same contents

⚠️ **Never taste test** - Can be lethal with fentanyl and other substances

⚠️ **Start low, go slow** - If you choose to use, use the smallest amount first

⚠️ **Have naloxone available** - Free through NEXT Distro and many health departments

⚠️ **Never use alone** - Have someone present or call Never Use Alone hotline (1-800-484-3731)

**Remember: This app exists to save lives through education, not to encourage substance use.** 💙
